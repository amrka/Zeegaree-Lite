Zeegaree-Lite
=============
Simple, yet good looking, Stopwatch and Timer app.

## Where does it work?
Zeegaree Lite was developed to work with desktop version of Ubuntu Unity in mind but it also should work on other Linux distros.

## Dependencies
**Zeegaree Lite needs few packages in order to work properly.**
These are:
- libqt4-sql-sqlite
- python-pyside
- gir1.2-unity
- gir1.2-notify
- maybe something more, let me know

2. Unpack it somewhere
3. From your terminal run: `python path-to-zeegaree_lite.py`
